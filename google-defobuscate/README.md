Google Search De-obfuscate
==========================

Because I got tired of having to do this step manually (copy, paste, select output, copy, re-paste to intended destination).
And I got annoyed that I'd always have to see their URL tracking crap.

What's important here
---------------------

*  defobuscate - a zsh wrapper for automating the middle bits
*  clip - a nice little clipboard automaton I found for dealing with the KDE clipboard across versions
*  search-deobfuscate.py - the bit that does the actual work

Notes
-----

*  This probably breaks on gnome at the moment. I'll find someone to find a relevant command
*  I also can't get pbcopy to work properly on ML right now. 'cept I can't care right now.
*  Feel free to turn it into a greasemonkey script or something
